function D = Detrend(M)% D = Detrend(M)%% Fits a plane to the surface defined by the elements of matrix M% and detrends the surface by subtracting the value of the planar% fit at each element. Returns the detrended surface in matrix D.% % Dependencies: lsplane.m% Copyright (C) 2004-2010 Taylor Perron <perron@mit.edu>% % This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it % under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the % Free Software Foundation.
